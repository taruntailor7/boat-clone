Our task is that we have to create a consumer electronics brand
the famous electronic e-commerce website boat-lifestyle clone with basic core functionalities and good looking user interface.

As we all know BoAt is an India-based consumer electronics brand established in 2015 that markets earphones, headphones stereos. BoAt is an Indian e-commerce company. It is India's fastest growing audio & wearables brand. The most incredible range of wireless earphones, earbuds, headphones, smart watches, and home audio.
